    <summary> About me </summary>
    I’m a Computer Science graduate from the University of Windsor with a passion for
    building scalable, secure, and efficient applications. My experience spans
    full-stack development, API design, and systems programming, with game development as a personal interest.

    I’m proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and C++, and have hands-on
    experience with frameworks and stacks such as MERN and Django.

    I also regularly work on diverse projects, including games, websites,
    and hardware-based builds using ESP32 microcontrollers, TFT displays, and related electronics.
